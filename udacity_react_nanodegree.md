Prerequisites and Requirements

To succeed in this program, you need to have experience with building front-end web applications with:

    HTML & CSS
    JavaScript
    Asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX)
    One or More Front-End Frameworks (Angular, Backbone, Ember, and more)
    Web Forms

You should have familiarity with the following:

    Web Accessibility Standards
    Using Node Package Manager (NPM)
    Git & GitHub
    Unix/Linux Command Line Basics
    
    
    
 React Fundamentals

By learning React's component model, you'll be able to write declarative, composable user interfaces to build production-ready apps.


Project
MyReads

Create a React application from scratch and utilize React components to manage the user interface. You’ll create a virtual bookcase to store your books and track what you're reading. Using the provided Books API, you’ll search for books and add them to a bookshelf as a React component. Use React's setState to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to another.

React & Redux

When your app's state becomes difficult to maintain, it's time to add Redux! By learning Redux, you'll manage complicated state to build enterprise-level apps.
Would you Rather

Leverage Redux’s strengths to build a “Would you Rather” application. You’ll build this dynamic application from scratch while combining the state management features of Redux with the declarative component model from React. When complete, you’ll be able to submit new questions, answer existing questions, and see the results.

React Native

You already use React to build your web apps. Now, using React Native, you’ll be able to develop React applications that run on both iOS and Android devices.

Project
PollMaker

Use React Native features to build a “Polls” application for both iOS and Android.
